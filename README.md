# k8s admin kit

I recently set up a new bare-metal Kubernetes cluster from scratch, on a few
dozen nodes that my research team inherited. This repository is just a place for
me to store and share any useful resources that I cobble together in the course
of administering the cluster. To start, it has only a `scripts` folder with a
couple items in it, but I hope to add more, including docs to remind myself of
how things work.
